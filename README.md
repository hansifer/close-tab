The menu item shortcut key is customizable in case the default `c` collides with an existing menu item.

#### Why is this useful?

Close Tab lets you close a web page with a right mouse click anywhere on the page followed by a key press. This is often quicker than moving the mouse cursor up to and clicking the tab's close icon or taking your hand off the mouse to use a keyboard shortcut that requires both hands.

#### macOS limitations

Close Tab has limited usefulness in macOS because macOS does not have customizable accelerator keys for menu items. The first letter of a menu item's title always serves as its accelerator key. Additionally, typing the first letter of a menu item only selects it; a subsequent Enter key press is required to activate it.

It's for these reasons that a Safari port of Close Tab doesn't exist and Close Tab's options UI doesn't show the menu item shortcut key selector on macOS.
