#### A browser extension that adds a tab close action to the page context menu

Available for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/closetab/lnchemdcmhoccciihokpdkkekmnejfhj) and [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/closetab/), but [not Safari](#macos)

The menu item shortcut key is customizable in case the default `c` collides with an existing menu item.

#### Why is this useful?

CloseTab enables you to close a web page with a right mouse click anywhere on the page followed by a key press. This is often quicker than moving the mouse cursor up to and clicking the tab's close icon.

#### macOS<a name="macos"></a>

CloseTab has limited usefulness in macOS because macOS does not have customizable accelerator keys for menu items. The first letter of a menu item's title always serves as its accelerator key. Additionally, typing the first letter of a menu item only selects it; a subsequent Enter key press is required to activate its action.

It's for these reasons that a Safari port of this extension doesn't exist and the options page does not display the menu item shortcut key selector for Chrome and Opera on macOS.
